Some nights, I don't even sleep
Chest tight with anxiety
Stay up to see the moon leave the sky
Some days, I'm not even me
Same old insecurities
They tell me there's something going wrong inside
I've been there, down that road
When you need me, I'll be here to let you know
It's gonna be okay
Everyone needs a bad day
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone
And call me whenever you're feeling lonely
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone
Break down 'cause you're breaking through
No sky is forever blue
